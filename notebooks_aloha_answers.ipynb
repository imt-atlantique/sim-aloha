In the case of slotted Aloha the vulnerable time is only T: any node who would like to send a frame between [-T; 0] before a transmission that happens at 0 will enter in collision. Because this node will wait until the next time slot, which is 0, and will start its frame at the same time. However, as soon as a node wants to send a frame after the starting of a transmission, it will not collide with the transmission, because it will wait until the next timeslot, i.e., T, i.e., the end of the current transmission. So in slotted aloha, only the T seconds before a transmission represents the vulnerable time._"
